1.If 7TB is the available disk space per node (9 disks with 1 TB, 2 disk for operating system etc.
were excluded.). Assuming initial data size is 600 TB. How will you estimate the number of data
nodes (n)?
			
		Inital ,we have data size=600 TB.
			Available disk space per node =7 TB
		
		Number of nodes=data size / available disk space 
			=600/7
			=86 nodes.(approx)





2.Imagine that you are uploading a file of 500MB into HDFS.100MB of data is successfully
uploaded into HDFS and another client wants to read the uploaded data while the upload is still in
progress. What will happen in such a scenario, will the 100 MB of data that is uploaded will it be
displayed?
		
	Yes, the first 100 MB that had been uploaded are visible to client.
	only the current block being written will not be visible by the readers.
	When that block had been written, it to visible to the client.
